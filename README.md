# Predicting_Traffic_Volume_with_PyTorch
Build a PyTorch-powered traffic prediction system using time-series skills and deep learning to forecast traffic volume. You can predict hourly traffic on interstate highways, considering seasonality and trends.

Build a deep learning model that predicts traffic volume and helps tackle challenges like congestion, road design, and smarter commutes:
1. Build a deep learning model using PyTorch to predict the traffic volume using the provided dataset. Initialize and save this model as traffic_model.
2. Train and evaluate your model using an appropriate loss function. Save the final training loss as a tensor variable, final_training_loss (aim for less than 20).
3. Predict the traffic volume against the test set and evaluate the performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE). Save your result as a tensor float, test_mse.
